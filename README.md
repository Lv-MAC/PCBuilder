# PCBuilder

PCBuilder is an Android application developed during my university time to demonstrate my skills in Android app development. The project focuses on creating a user-friendly interface for building custom PC configurations. Although the project is not yet fully completed, I am sharing it with the GitHub community so that others can explore the code and use it for their own needs.
